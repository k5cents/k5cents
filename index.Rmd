## Bio

I'm an analyst at [Catalist], where I work on polling and modeling voter
behavior in the cloud. I have a Master's degree in Political Science from
[American University], where I studied the legislative process and predicting
elections. I've worked in polling for the [DCCC] and data acquisition for the
non-profit [Investigative Reporting Workshop].

## Projects

* [`/models-markets`][mm] - Comparing probabilistic predictions of elections
* [`/campfin`][campfin] - Exploring and normalizing campaign finance data
* [`/metro`][metro] - Requesting WMATA public transit data from an API
* [`/fflr`][fflr] - Requesting ESPN fantasy football data from an API
* [`/usa`][usa] - New-ish facts and figures about the United States
* [`/k5`][k5] - Personal package for interactive programming
