## Bio

I am a political scientist with experience in opinion polling and data
management. I graduated with a Master of Arts in Political Science from
[American University][au] in 2019. Since then, I've worked in polling for the
[DCCC][dccc] and data analysis for the non-profit [Investigative Reporting
Workshop][irw].

I live in the District of Columbia but was born and raised in Vermont. My other
interests include open-source R coding and playing poker.

## Projects

* [`/models-markets`][mm] - Comparing probabilistic predictions of elections
* [`/campfin`][campfin] - Exploring and normalizing campaign finance data
* [`/metro`][metro] - Requesting WMATA public transit data from an API
* [`/fflr`][fflr] - Requesting ESPN fantasy football data from an API
