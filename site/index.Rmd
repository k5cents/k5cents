I am a political scientist with experience in opinion polling and data
management. I graduated with a Master of Arts in Political Science from
[American University][au] in 2019. Since then, I've worked in polling for the
[DCCC][dccc] and data analytics for the non-profit [Investigative Reporting
Workshop][irw].

I live in the District of Columbia but was born in raised in Vermont, where my
love for the environment started. My other interests include open-source R
coding and playing amateur poker.
